# react-drum-machine

A little drum machine written in React and created as part of the [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) front-end development curriculum.
it is fonctionnal, the sounds can be played with a mouse click or a button pression. The design is not finished, I didn't make it fully responsive.
Also, for this app, I used a React component to display the two different sound banks in a drop-down list.
